# turtle_stack_problem
The program asks the user to enter the capacity and weight of an arbitrary number of turtles and then tells what is the 
maximum number of turtles that can be stacked one upon the other such that every turtle has to lift its own weight and 
the weight of all the turtles above it and the total weight on any turtle does not exceed its capacity.
